# Static keyword



Static variables can be accessed using just the class name. No need to instantiate the class! Static variables are shared among all instances of a class. 

Example is fx the `String.format` method

Typically refers to common property

Cannot reach `this`!



## When to use static?

- `main` method must be static
- When you want to have a variable that describes something about the class itself, not the individual objects of that class
- When you want to have a variable that *always* has the same value for *every* object of the class, forever and ever.
- If you have a method that does not use any instance variables or instance methods, you should *probably* make it `static`



```java
public class Student {
  public static String schoolName = "KEA";
}
```



```java
System.out.println(Student.schoolName); // KEA
```

No need for instantiating the `Student` class. `schoolName` is available on the class itself ðŸ˜±
