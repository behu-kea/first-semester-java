You have now learned all the necessary building blocks of Java. `String`, `int`, `forloop`, `methods`, `conditional` these are all blocks that we need to build Java. **But** in order to write code that is 

- Better structured
- Better abstracted
- More maintainable
- More secure

we need to talk about classes! 

It's an essential part of Java that allows us to represent data in a better way.



## But why??

Let's go through a concrete example where classes can help us writte better code. 

Let's say we have an application that works with students. It could be an application that creates schedules for a school. 

Let's say a student has a name, an age and an array of his/her grades. Lets try and represent that with the code we have learned so far:

```java
String studentName = "Cathrine Hansson";
int age = 23;
int[] grades = {10, 4, 7, 7};
```

Okay, so this kind of works. I could do some operations on the individual variables, like finding the highest grade. But now a new student comes in, hmm. Okay let's rewrite the codeüëá

```java
String studentName1 = "Cathrine Hansson";
int age1 = 23;
int[] grades1 = {10, 4, 7, 7};

String studentName2 = "Peter Jon";
int age2 = 27;
int[] grades2 = {12, 4, 4, 7};
```

Hmm okay that's not super nice. What if there were 200 students in the system, then i would have to create 200 students * 3 attributes = 600 variables. This would simply not work and would be **massively** error prone. So then what? In comes classes. 



## Object orientation

- As applications grows - their code base grows
- As growth implies complexity, it is beneficial to organise code into 
  understandable & manageable groupings.
- Object orientation is a concept - ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù - of writing programs.
- We hide complexity through abstraction



### Thinking object oriented

![Thinking object oriented](../../assets/thinking-object-oriented.png)



Let's look at creating a cat. What parameter could be relevant? What is the blueprint of a cat? 



![Class object metaphor](../../assets/class-objects-metaphor.png)



**Cookie cutter (blueprint)**

```java
class Cat {
    public String name;
    public int mood;
    public boolean isHungry;
    public int energy;

    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("meow");
    }
}
```

Here we create a new class called `Cat` with 4 attributes: `name`, `mood`, `isHungry` and `energy`. We also add a method to the class called `meow`



**Cookies (objects/instance of Student)**

```java
public class CatStarter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat figaro = new Cat();
        figaro.meow();
        figaro.name = "figaro";
    }
}
```

Here we instantiate a new instance/object of the `Cat` class by saying

`Cat figaro = new Cat();`. `Cat figaro` means create a variable with the name of figaro, the type should be `Cat`. To create the object we say `new Cat();`. This will create a new object.



### Constructor

![Constructors](../../assets/constructors.png)

![Variable assignment](../../assets/variable-assignment.png)



As we saw before we could change the name of `figaro` by writing 

```java
figaro.name = "figaro";
```

There is a better way to do this using the constructor. Lets update the `Cat.java` class:



```java
class Cat {
    public String name;
    public int mood;
    public boolean isHungry;
    public int energy;

    public Cat(String name, int mood, boolean isHungry, int energy) {
        this.name = name;
        this.mood = mood;
        this.isHungry = isHungry;
        this.energy = energy;
    }

    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("meow");
    }
}
```

Let's create a new object using the constructor

```java
public class CatStarter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat figaro = new Cat("figaro", 5, true, 7);
        figaro.meow();
        System.out.println(figaro.name); // "figaro"
    }
}
```

The constructor is a method that constructs the object. 

When we create a new object we say `Cat figaro = new Cat("figaro", 5, true, 7)`; So we call this method üëâ `Cat("figaro", 5, true, 7)` . The method that is called is the constructor! The constructor looks like this:

```java
public Cat(String name, int mood, boolean isHungry, int energy) {
  this.name = name;
  this.mood = mood;
  this.isHungry = isHungry;
  this.energy = energy;
}
```

The constructor takes parameters but does not have a return type!

The parameters will be replaced with the arguments you create the object with. Just like how arguments and parameters work in methods. 



### `this`

`this` refers to the instance of the object. 

 `figaro` and `this` is the same thing but inside a class we use `this` to refer to the instance of the object! That means that we set the name (`"figaro"`) that came from creating a new object to be the name of the object. 



### `toString`

Printing out the values inside an object can be very helpful! But when we `println` an object it gives us `Cat@4f023edb`. This print the name of the class and the Dashcode. We can't really use this for anything. 

```java
Cat figaro = new Cat("figaro", 5, true, 7);
System.out.println(figaro); // Cat@4f023edb
```

In order to print an object's attributes we have to create a `toString` method üëá

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Cat{" +
            "name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", mood=" + mood +
            ", isHungry=" + isHungry +
            ", energy=" + energy +
            '}';
}
```

In the `toString` method we simply return a string with the values we would like to show. Ignore the `@override` annotation for now. You will learn that soon!

In IntelliJ there is a shortcut for generating the `toString` method automatically. 

```java
Cat figaro = new Cat("figaro", 5, true, 7);
System.out.println(figaro); // Cat{name='figaro', mood=5, isHungry=true, energy=7}
```







## Exercises



### Exercise 1

Create a `Dog` class. The class should have

- 4 attributes that you choose
- 1 method that you choose
- Create 2 instances of dogs using the constructor!

Now call the method on the two dog objects. 



## Exercise 1.1

There is a car, which has attributes *model* and *price*, and the car has functionalities *start*, *stop* and *move*. Also, there is a driver, having attributes *name* and *age*, and the behaviour *drive*.

Create the classes *Car* and *Driver*. The functionality of the methods does not matter. Just print something to the console



### Exercise 2 - Lampeopgave 

1. Skriv en klasse der hedder `Lamp`. 
2. `Lamp` har en boolean instansvariabel der angiver om den er t√¶ndt eller slukket. 
3. N√•r man laver et nyt `lamp`-objekt skal der v√¶re en constructor hvor man kan v√¶lge om lampen som udgangspunkt er t√¶ndt eller slukket
4. Skriv en metode der hedder `toggleLight`, som t√¶nder lampen hvis den er slukket, og slukker lampen hvis den er t√¶ndt. 
5. Lav en klasse (du kan fx kalde den `Room`) med en main-metode hvor du instantierer forskellige lampeobjekter (skrivebordslampe, sengelampe el. lign.) og tester om de virker som de skal. 
6. Lav en attribut i `Lamp` der holder √∏je med hvor mange gange lamp er blevet togglet
7. Lav en metode der returnerer antal gange lampen er togglet.
8. Lav en static variabel i `Lamp`-klassen som t√¶ller hvor mange lamper der er lavet



### Exercise 3

Create a `DogFarm` class that creates and returns `Dog` objects with data input from the user.

The maximum / minimum of mood, energy & hunger is 10 / 0

If a method that raises an attribute to more / less than 10 / 0 - The attribute do not change, but prints out - Cat is at max / min [mood/energy/hunger]
