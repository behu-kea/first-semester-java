## How this course will be run

In a normal week you will have lectures each day from monday to friday. In project weeks the teachers will schedule time for guidance for the different groups. 

This gitbook will be where you can find all information about this course. You can find the plan for the different weeks, the different topics that we will be going through and information about exams. 



This course will be run with two main focuses:

1. Flipped classroom teachings
2. Project based learning



### Flipped classroom teachings

All lectures has been filmed and put on YouTube. **Before** some classes it is expected that you as students have watched and taken notes for video that prepares you for the class. 

This means that we as teacher will do very little traditional teaching. The classes will instead be spent on exercises, projects, pair programming, quizzes etc. We as teachers can spend more time on guiding and helping you through tough problems. 



### Project based learning

Project based learning is learning through doing projects. These projects will solve real world problems and it will give you an opportunity to demonstrate your skills. They will involve you designing your project, working in groups, communicating, documenting what you have done and helping your teammates. 



## Studieordningen
