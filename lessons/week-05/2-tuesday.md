#### Visual paradigm

Going forward we will be drawing diagrams to design & document code. 

Download visual paradigm and use the following academic license by following this guide:

### Three steps to improve code quality and document changes:

#### Exercise 1 - Document program:

- Finish the diagram such that it documents the Crypto Converter program

#### Exercise 2 - refactor code:

- Implement error handling as a try/catch in your Crypto Converter
- If the user enters input that does not contain numbers
  - Handle the exception by informing the user of wrong input and ask the user for input again

#### Exercise 3 - Update documentation:

- Update the documentation such that the newly refactored code is documented
- This can be modelled as an alt scenario:
