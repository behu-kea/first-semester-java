Factory pattern: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm

### Implement the factory pattern in CoffeCollective such that:

- Instead of the menu directly instantiates an Americano, Espresso or Tea, the responsibility to create new objects are assigned to an Abstract Factory
- Instead of the menu directly instantiates a Baguette or Croissant, the responsibility to create new objects are assigned to an Abstract Factory

### (Advanced optional)

- Configure the abstract factories such that it reads prices from a file
- In this way - a Coffee Collective administrator can make changes in prices without changing the source code
