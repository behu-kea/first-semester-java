We will today be creating a tamagotchi. A tamagotchi is a virtual pet that you can interact with. It was quite a big deal back when i was young. Not so much anymore. 

A tamagotchi had to be kept alive. You could feed it, play with it, dress it etc. 



## Tamagotchi details

We have to create 4 different classes

1. `Game` - Class that initiates a game and takes user input
2. `Tamagotchi` - Super class for creating tamagotchis
3. `Cat` - A class that inherits from `Tamagotchi`
4. `Dog` - A class that also inherits from `Tamagotchi`



### `Game` class

This class can be seen as the "main" class. It takes data from a user and now creates either a `Cat` object or a `Dog` object. 





### `Tamagotchi` class





### 



Create a game that can spawn a `cat` or a `dog`.
